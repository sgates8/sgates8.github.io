         <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello! I am Sylvia Gates, a full stack web developer.
            Born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, tech is
            inbedded in my framework. Growing up surrounded by techies,
            I have always been interested in the internet and how
            apps work. With an affinity for all things asthetically
            pleasing and efficient; I am drawn to UI/UX friendly apps.
            My diverse background in retail, beauty, and tech makes me
            a unique contributer to the world of web develpment. As
            you view my work, it is my desire that my passion for UI/UX
            shines through. Ultimately, it is my goal to create and
            contribute to projects that are intuitive, responsive,
            fast, and dynamic.</p>
